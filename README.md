## TypeScript 
Get hands-on interactive practice with this free TypeScript tutorial and learn the foundational knowledge and skills you need to become a TypeScript Wizard.

### In this TypeScript tutorial you will:

- Learn to type variables, functions, and errors  

- Become familiar with the TypeScript documentation

- Gain experience with modern TypeScript tooling

## Zod

### What is Zod?

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. I'm using the term "schema" to broadly refer to any data type, from a simple string to a complex nested object.
Zod is designed to be as developer-friendly as possible. The goal is to eliminate duplicative type declarations. With Zod, you declare a validator once and Zod will automatically infer the static TypeScript type. It's easy to compose simpler types into complex data structures.

## React with TypeScript

TypeScript's features and developer experience make a great combination with React, but it can be confusing to get started.

What’s the best way to type component props? What are these weird useRef errors?

That's where this React with TypeScript tutorial comes in!

Starting from the very beginning of bringing TS support to a React project, you'll soon find yourself properly typing hooks and mastering components. You’ll learn everything you need to know to get productive with React and TypeScript.

### Tutorial topics include:

- Reading React's type definitions to debug errors and ensure correct usage
- Defining props for custom and React.FC function components.
- Putting TypeScript's inference to work for you
- Supporting component children
- Typing and overriding event handlers
- Utilizing ComponentProps to extract properties from imported components or HTML DOM elements
- Understanding the APIs and typing for useState, useCallback, useEffect, and other React Hooks. By the end of this workshop, you'll be confident when using React with TypeScript in your own projects!
